              <p>Stress can be both beneficial and detrimental.<br>
                Experiencing both positive and negative stress is a normal part of life.<br>
                Positive stress can be beneficial, helping to boost productivity and provide stimulation, <br>
                preventing boredom and isolation.<br>
                Nonetheless, it is crucial to ensure periods of recovery and rest, even with positive stress.<br>
                Without proper rest, the body may exhibit physical symptoms as a reaction to sustained stress.<br>

                <li>Social media and technology</li></p>
                
                <p>You can also experience stress from:
                
                <li>Personal attitudes</li>
                <li>Beliefs</li>
                <li>Expectations</li>
                <li>Perceptions</li>
              
                As you see, there are things you can practice and process with your internal factors to help you handle stress.<br>
                By understanding the different facets of stress,
