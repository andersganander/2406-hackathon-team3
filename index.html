              <p >Understanding Stress

                Stress is a response that begins in the mind, shaped by our reactions to external situations
                and our capacity to manage these reactions.
                Mental stress, in particular, arises from how we perceive expectations and demands
                and our ability to cope with them.

              <p>Stress can be both beneficial and detrimental.<br>
                Experiencing both positive and negative stress is a normal part of life.<br>
                Positive stress can be beneficial, helping to boost productivity and provide stimulation, <br>
                preventing boredom and isolation.<br>
                Nonetheless, it is crucial to ensure periods of recovery and rest, even with positive stress.<br>
                Without proper rest, the body may exhibit physical symptoms as a reaction to sustained stress.<br>

                <li>Work-related pressures</li>
               <li>Financial problems</li>
                <li>Major life changes</li>
                <li>Relationship issues</li>
                <li>Social media and technology</li></p>

                <p>You can also experience stress from:

                <li>Personal attitudes</li>
                <li>Beliefs</li>
                <li>Expectations</li>
                <li>Perceptions</li>

                As you see, there are things you can practice and process with your internal factors to help you handle stress.<br>
                By understanding the different facets of stress,
                you can create effective management strategies and navigate stress to maintain your overall well-being.</p>

              <p >Understanding Stress

                Stress is a response that begins in the mind, shaped by our reactions to external situations
                and our capacity to manage these reactions.
                Mental stress, in particular, arises from how we perceive expectations and demands
                and our ability to cope with them.
